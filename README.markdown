==Shopify Store Wrapper

This is a fork from Glnn's Shopify Store Wrapper. It is essentially an interface to get information from a Shopify shop that is available through the Shopify API for use in iOS. I am adding more interfaces to it for a future iOS app idea. 


==Interfaces available so far

1. getProducts - Gets all the products in a shop.

2. getOrders - Gets all orders for a shop.

3. addItemToCart:(NSString *)itemID - Adds an item from the shop to the Shopify cart, takes the product_id as a parameter.
